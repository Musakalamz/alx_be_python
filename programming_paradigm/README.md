# 🧠 Programming Paradigms & Exception Handling (Python)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a structured set of Python exercises designed to introduce and reinforce **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, **robust exception handling**, and **foundational testing practices**.

The project aligns with real-world engineering expectations: clean design, defensive coding, and verifiable behavior through automated tests. Each task builds incrementally, mirroring how production systems evolve over time.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

### 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming
- Explain and apply core OOP concepts:
  - Classes and objects
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
- Distinguish between:
  - Instance attributes vs. class attributes
  - Instance methods
  - Proper usage of the `self` keyword
- Design simple but maintainable object models

### ⚠️ Exception Handling
- Differentiate between syntax errors and runtime exceptions
- Identify common Python exceptions and their causes
- Handle failures gracefully using:
  - `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`
- Raise built-in and custom exceptions intentionally

### 🧪 Testing Fundamentals
- Explain why testing is critical in professional software development
- Describe different testing types, with emphasis on **unit testing**
- Write effective tests using Python’s `unittest` framework
- Run and interpret test results using Python test runners
