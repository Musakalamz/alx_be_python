# Functions, Data Structures, and Modules in Python

---

## Project Overview

This project explores the **fundamentals of Python programming** with a focus on:

- **Functions** – defining, utilizing, and managing scope
- **Data Structures** – Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- **Modules and Libraries** – creating, importing, and leveraging built-in and external modules

You will gain practical experience writing **clean, reusable, and well-structured Python code**.

---

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

### Functions

- Understand the **purpose and importance** of functions in Python
- Construct functions using `def` and `lambda` keywords
- Work with **parameters, argument passing**, default values, and keyword arguments
- Utilize **return values** effectively
- Distinguish between **local and global variable scope**
- Apply **global** and **nonlocal** keywords appropriately

### Data Structures

- Identify and use Python's core data structures: **Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**
- Perform operations on **Lists** (indexing, slicing, appending, etc.)
- Utilize **Dictionary methods**, understand the **immutability of Tuples**, and perform **Set operations**
- Select the **appropriate data structure** for different scenarios

### Modules and Libraries

- Understand **modules and packages** in Python
- Create and use **custom modules**
- Import and utilize **standard Python modules**
- Install and use **external libraries** with `pip`
- Identify essential Python libraries (e.g., `requests`) and their use cases

### Variable Scope and Namespaces

- Comprehend the **LEGB rule** (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in)
- Implement best practices for **variable scope management**
- Explain **namespaces**, their types, and lifecycle
- Understand **scope resolution** in Python

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you will be able to:

- Write **clean, maintainable, and reusable code**
- Effectively manage **data and functions** for practical tasks
- Utilize **Python modules and external libraries** to extend functionality
- Apply **best practices** in variable scope and namespace management

## Example Tasks Included

1. **Arithmetic Operations Function**

   ```python
   # perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
   # handles division by zero
   from arithmetic_operations import perform_operation
   ```

2. **Shopping List Manager**

   ```python
   # dynamically manage a shopping list using lists and user input
   ```

3. **Explore `datetime` Module**

   ```python
   # display current date/time
   # calculate future dates using timedelta
   ```

4. **Temperature Conversion Tool**
   ```python
   # convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit
   # uses global variables for conversion factors
   ```
